Complex memory expressions  can  be  modeled  using  the  Lambda  notation  introduced
by Bryant et al. \cite{bryant2002modeling} for term-level modeling; this includes the
standard write (store) primitive for modeling arrays, as well
as more general operations such as parallel updates to arrays,
operations on CAMs, queues, and other data structures.

verification problem is known to  be  undecidable  in  general  since  a
two-counter machine can be encoded in our formalism using
applications  of  uninterpreted  functions \cite{isles1998computing}

abstraction is a form of localization abstraction \cite{kurshan1994automata},
where the localization is to small, finite portions of large data
structures.
